# Data Wrangling Analysis & A/B Testing 
### Description:
The objective was to analyse the results of A/B testing for a hypothetical online shopping company.

1. Compare the final_assignments_qa table to the assignment events we captured for user_level_testing. Write an answer to the following question: Does this table have everything you need to compute metrics like 30-day view-binary?
2.  Reformat the final_assignments_qa to look like the final_assignments table, filling in any missing values with a placeholder of the appropriate data type.
3.  Use this table to compute order_binary for the 30-day window after the test_start_date for the test named item_test_2.
4.  Use the final_assignments table to calculate the view binary, and average views for the 30-day window after the test assignment for item_test_2.
5.  Use the https://thumbtack.github.io/abba/demo/abba.html to compute the lifts in metrics and the p-values for the binary metrics (30-day order binary and 30-day view binary) using an interval of 95% confidence.
